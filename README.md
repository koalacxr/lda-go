# lda-go
===========
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/lda-go plus some bug fixes.

## Fixes
- 1. Deprecated old version libs/functions;
- 2. Bug in iter.Next() function;
- 3. Bug(or typo) in train.go;
- 4. Restructured the proj and added more examples.

But this one still does not seem correct to me.
